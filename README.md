astronautlabs/diazo) graphs, as well as defines its "context" layer, which is 
the non-UI specific portions of the editor.

# Installation

npm install @diazo/model
```

# Usage

When implementing backend services that consume Diazo graphs, you'll want to 
import this package so you are able to add strong types.
